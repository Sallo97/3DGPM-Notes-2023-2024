\section{2D Shapes}

\subsection{Cicle Equation}
Given the center $(x_{0}, y_{0})$ and the radius $r^{2}$ we define the circle by the following implicit function:
\begin{equation*}
    (x - x_{0})^{2} + (y - y_{0})^{2} = r^{2}
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Ellipse Equation}
Given the center $(x_{0}, y_{0})$ and the minor axis (think it as the shortest radius) $b$ and major axis (think it as the greater radius) $a$, we can define the ellipse by the following implicit function:
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{(x - x_{0})^{2}}{a^{2}} + \frac{(y - y_{0})^{2}}{b^{2}} = 1
\end{equation*}

\section{3D Solids}

\subsection{Sphere Equation}
Given the radius of the sphere $r$, the area of the sphere is defined by the following implicit equation:

\begin{equation*}
    x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2} = r^{2}
\end{equation*}
